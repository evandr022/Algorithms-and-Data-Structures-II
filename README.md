# Algorithms and Data Structures II

Amazonas Federal University

Discipline: ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES II

Professor: Edson Nascimento Silva Jr.

Summary: Notions on algorithm complexity. Sorting algorithms: quadratic, linear and cost-optimal algorithms. Sequential and binary search algorithms. Hash table. String processing. Trees (Binary Search Trees and Balanced Trees). Representation of graphs and Path Algorithms, Applications: Topological sorting and shortest path.

Objective: Evaluate the efficiency of computational routines built with basic and advanced data structures. Experiment with different ways of implementing algorithms, especially the use of the concept of data encapsulation. Compare different search and sorting algorithms. Contribute to the development of the student's creativity and logical thinking, key pieces for the construction of efficient computational routines.
